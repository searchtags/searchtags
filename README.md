Open Search Tags: List

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/searchtags/searchtags.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/searchtags/searchtags)

This is a list of common used search engines (including aliases like "wa" for Wolfram Alpha).
"Open Search Tags" is heavily inspired by [DuckDuckGo's bangs] [1] and also [Ecosia's search tags] [2].
Using those techniques you can easier access other search engines by using specific aliases.

This package contains only the list of search engine definitions and aliases.

## Files

* `searchtags.json` – The list itself
* `schema.json` – A schema file to validate above list
* `index.js` – JavaScript entry point (to use the list easier in NodeJS)
