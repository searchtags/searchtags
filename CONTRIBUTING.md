# Contributing Guidelines

Before adding or editing search engines or aliases, make sure you followed this list:

* Avoid duplicates (maybe you want to add an alias or fix the existing one?)
* Use "en" as fallback or default language, if website also provides content in English
* Don't use affiliate tags or keywords in your URLs (especially for shopping pages)
* Don't use "Open Search Tags" to promote your recently created website
* Don't use "Open Search Tags" for other purposes than simple search queries (e.g. MD5 hashing, 
  parsing programming phrases)
* Follow the order of aliases or definitions:
  1. 1-letter aliases in alphabetical order
  2. 2-letter aliases in alphabetical order
  3. 3-letter aliases in alphabetical order
  5. search definitions in alphabetical order
